/////
rather than componentDidMount we used componentWillMount
to ensure that interceptors are set before making get request for 
fetching the ingredients
componentDidMount inside errorHandler ran after WrappedComponent was rendered by errorHandler
so interceptors were not set
by using componentWillMount interceptors were set inside errorHandler 
then we made the rendered WrappedComponent then we make get request

// 
we added componentWillUnmount
to eject the interceptors to ensure that when we unmount burgerBuilder 
interceptors are unset otherwise 
where ever we use withErrorHandler multiple interceptors will stay inside memory 
so clearing them when they were no longer needed was important
